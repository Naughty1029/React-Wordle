## Features
Guess the WORDLE in six tries.  
Each guess must be a valid five-letter word. Hit the enter button to submit.  
After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

Green tile is in the word and in the correct spot.

Yellow tile is in the word but in the wrong spot.

Grey tile is not in the word in any spot.
